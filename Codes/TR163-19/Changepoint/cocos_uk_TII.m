% This code is modified from seonmin's LeadLag_ChangePoint_0604.m to calculate
% the probability of the MD20 record to lead the MD20_UP record across
% Termination II.

% This code computes the cdfs of two change points and the cdf difference of two change points.
% Sampling results from the HMM-match and the change points algorithm are
% required. (seonmin_ahn@brown.edu)
