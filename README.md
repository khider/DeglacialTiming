# DeglacialTiming

This repository contains the code and data accompanying the paper currently in review in Paleoceanography.

The repository is organized as follows:
* Data: Folder contains the original data in [LiPD](http://wiki.linked.earth/Linked_Paleo_Data) format. Each file contains the original data as well as the ensemble age and SST tables.
* Code: This folder contains the Matlab routine used to obtain the (1) age model ensembles, (2) SST ensembles, (3) the change point, and (4) uncertainty contribution estimates.
